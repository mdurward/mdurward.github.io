<div class="w3-container w3-pale-blue w3-bottombar"><p> As part of my ongoing blogging activities and general sharing of knowledge and resources, I have developed this website to
  link to some of the resources I have created myself, or adapted from uplugged activities.
<br />This will also work to develop my
  own HTML/CSS/JS skills, so this page will theoretically improve over time.</p></div>
<div class="w3-container w3-teal"><h3><a href="binarycards.html">Binary Converter - 4 Cards</a></h3></div>
<div class="w3-container w3-pale-blue w3-bottombar"><p>This is an interactive version of the CS Unplugged binary cards activity.
  This was made to help deliver the Teachers Can Code Module 2 sessions online. </p></div>

<div class="w3-container w3-teal"><h3><a href="kidfax1.html">Kid Fax Challenge 1</a></h3></div>
<div class="w3-container w3-teal w3-bottombar"><h3><a href="kidfax2.html">Kid Fax Challenge 2</a></h3></div>
<div class="w3-container w3-pale-blue w3-bottombar"><p> This is also an activity meant to be paired with Teachers Can Code Module 2. It is the first Kid Fax activity.
  Others will be added soon </p></div>

<div class="w3-container w3-teal"><h3><a href="sortstreet.html">Sort the street</a></h3></div>
<div class="w3-container w3-pale-blue w3-bottombar"><p> This is a remake of <a href="https://nrich.maths.org/content/id/5157/houses.swf">this</a> resource. I remade that to
  attempt dragging objects in javascript, as well as to future-proof it for when Flash is shut down in the coming years.
  It was made using Wick Editor. This version works, but needs to be zoomed out to work on most screens. Will be updating soon.</p></div>
