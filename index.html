  <div class="w3-container w3-pale-blue w3-bottombar w3-small"><p> As part of my ongoing blogging activities and general sharing of knowledge and resources, I have developed this website to
    link to some of the resources I have created myself, or adapted from uplugged activities.
  <br />This will also work to develop my
    own HTML/CSS/JS skills, so this page will theoretically improve over time.</p></div>
